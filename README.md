# sewervision
internship with The University of Sheffield.

In this project I worked with Dr Lyudmila Mihaylova and Dr Aristeidis Karnezis where I was given the task to create a machine vision system to detect defects in a sewer system.

Version 5 is the up to date working version.

version 1,2,3 and 4 are out dated old versions.

The Water Research dataset used was from SPRING using this link: https://ukwir2021.my.site.com/spring/s/login/?ec=302&startURL=%2Fspring%2Fs%2Fuser-voice%2Fa0JNz0000005dAPMAY%2Funited-utilities-artificial-intelligence-and-sewers

To use this model you must change the datapaths in the code to where you have stored and where you would like to store the datasets.
